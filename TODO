* Local add/delete refactoring: the current solution seems somewhat unwieldy, come up with a better
concept & implement it.
* Remove all file deletions from DB methods
* Unify all communications with the backend. At this point, I'm not even sure what the recommended
way is; SynchronousSyncResponder??
* Simplify the backend: get rid of the AIDL version and convert all of it into a basic IntentService (or similar).
* Replace the player controls with MediaController
* Refactor the media player backend
